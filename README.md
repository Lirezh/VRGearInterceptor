VRGearInterceptor
=================

A tool to be used to correct the lens separation values in software when shifting the lenses of the Oculus Rift (DK2) either more narrow or wider with the help of the physical VR-Gear adjusters or other custom mod.

Specifically this tool intercepts messages to and from the OVRServer service and the client application. A change in the port of the OVRServer files is required for this method to work and that requires some hex searching and editing.
